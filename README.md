# Student-Performance-Prediction
This repository contains the analysis and modeling of student academic performance using datasets from Portuguese and Mathematics courses. The main objective is to explore the data, analyze key factors, and build predictive models to estimate students’ final grades.

Project Structure

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and merging datasets of Mathematics (395 students) and Portuguese (649 students).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding variables such as alcohol consumption, study time, family background, and school support.

Feature Engineering: Selection of relevant predictors.

Modeling: Application of supervised learning techniques to predict final grades.

Evaluation: Comparison of different models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) with appropriate performance metrics.

Dataset

The data includes information about students’ personal background, social habits, and school-related factors. Some examples of variables:

Study time

Absences

Parental education

Alcohol consumption

Romantic relationships

Support from family and school

Note: The dataset is originally available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: Student Performance Data Set.
